        "1. Data live on irregular observation networks\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Nodes: weather stations, buoys, radars, cities;\n",
        "*   Edges: geographic proximity, or learned similarity (correlated temperature, wind, elevation, etc.). GNNs naturally handle non-uniform station layouts, unlike CNNs that assume a regular grid. Reviews and recent work emphasize this as a key motivation for using GNNs in short- to medium-range forecasting.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. You need spatio-temporal dependence across sites. ST-GNNs can learn how signals propagate between locations over time (e.g., fronts, advection, local micro-climates).\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Weather forecasting from station networks\n",
        "*   Frost and minimum-temperature prediction over an IoT network and nearby stations to predict minimum temperature and frost incidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Air-quality and environmental prediction. Air-quality stations form a natural graph; GNNs model pollutant transport and meteorological influence between sites.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Post-processing and bias correction of NWP / ensembles. GNNs can take coarse-resolution ensemble forecasts plus station observations, treat stations (or grid cells) as nodes, and learn spatially coherent correction fields, improving local forecast skill and spatial coherence.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. High-resolution regional nowcasting and interpolation. For complex terrain or urban areas, GNNs can connect irregular observation sites and interpolate or nowcast fields (temperature, precipitation, wind) at high spatial and temporal resolution, providing an alternative to dense grids.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, technically:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Use a GNN when your atmospheric or climate data are naturally represented as nodes connected by physical or statistical relationships (stations, cities, grid cells, ensemble members).\n",
        "*   Use a spatio-temporal GNN when you need to learn how signals evolve both across space (advection, teleconnections, micro-climates) and time, especially on irregular networks where CNNs on regular grids are a poor fit."
